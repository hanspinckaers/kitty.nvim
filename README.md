# kitty.nvim
Slime-like REPL for Neovim in Lua

This is a very simple, single file plugin.

I might get more organized but right now the scope is only to be able 
to send either 

	- selected text
	- "# %%" formatted jupyter notebook cells
	- whole files
	- lines
	- current word

To the last recently focused kitty pane.

This is pretty much all I need - but PR's welcome
